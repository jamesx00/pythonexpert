## How to run Python code on our site

In the early part of the course, everyone can run Python code on the website without having to install Python on their own computer.

For those who learn through a computer, you will see an online code editor on the left-hand side. For smaller devices, you will see a code-writing area below the content of each lesson. Everyone can run their own code by clicking the **Run** button or by pressing ++ctrl+enter++. The output of the program will be displayed below the code editor.

We can write anything to the output panel by calling the function `print()` in Python. Anything inside the parentheses will be printed out.

We recommend that everyone learn the lessons through a computer or a device with a large enough screen to make coding easier.
