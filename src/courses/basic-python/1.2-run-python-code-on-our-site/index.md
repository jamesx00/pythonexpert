In the early part of the course, everyone can run Python code on the website without having to install Python on their own computer.

For those who learn through a computer, you will see an online code editor on the left-hand side. For smaller devices, you will see a code-writing area below the content of each lesson. Everyone can run their own code by clicking the **Run** button or by pressing ++ctrl+enter++. The output of the program will be displayed below the code editor.

We can write anything to the output panel by calling the function `print()` in Python. Anything inside the parentheses will be printed out.

We recommend that everyone learn the lessons through a computer or a device with a large enough screen to make coding easier.
