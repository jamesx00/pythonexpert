In Python, comments are used to add explanatory notes or remarks to the code, without affecting the actual execution of the program. The interpreter ignores comments while executing the program. Comments are a useful tool for documenting code, providing context, and making it easier for others to understand your code.

Python has two ways to create comments:

### Single-line comments

Single-line comments start with a hash symbol `#` and continue until the end of the line. Anything after the hash symbol on that line is ignored by the interpreter.
Example:

```python
# This is a single-line comment in Python
print("Hello World!")  # This line will print "Hello World!"
```

### Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments are created by enclosing a block of text in triple quotes `"""`, also known as `docstrings`. These can be used for documenting classes, functions, and modules.
Example:

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment or docstring in Python.
It can span across multiple lines and can be used to
document classes, functions, and modules.
"""

def greet(name):
    """
    This function greets the person passed in as a parameter.
    """
    print("Hello, " + name + ". How are you?")
```
